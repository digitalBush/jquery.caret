Caret Plugin for jQuery
=======================

Overview
--------
This is the caret positioning code that I created to use in my [Masked Input plugin for jQuery](http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin). This plugin will let you manipulate or query the caret position of text inputs and textareas.

The following calls are available
* ###.caret()### - gets the current caret position for the first element in the set of matched elements. 
* ###.caret(begin,end)### - sets the caret position on the set of matched elements.
* ###.caret(begin)### - sets the caret position on the set of matched elements.  This is the same same calling .caret with the same begin and end value.
